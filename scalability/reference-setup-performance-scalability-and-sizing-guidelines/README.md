# Reference Setup, Performance, Scalability, and Sizing Guidelines

In this document, we present the reference setup, performance, scalability, and sizing guidelines when using the Longhorn storage system. 
In practice, users deploy Longhorn in a vast array of different cluster specifications, making it impossible for us to test all potential setups. 
Therefore, we will select and test some typical environments for users' reference. 
By providing these references, users can gain insight into how Longhorn would perform in a similar cluster specification.

## Public Cloud
